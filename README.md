# Hi, My Name is Lakshya <img width="45" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LakshyaKhatri/LakshyaKhatri/master/img/waving_hand.gif">
I'm a 4<sup>th</sup> year Information Technology student from India. I mostly work on Python projects, but I occasionally change languages for getting a different taste. Iâ€™m currently contributing to Open-Source projects under [@JuliaLang](https://github.com/JuliaLang/) as part of the [@MLH-Fellowship](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/) program. You can hit me up on any social meda platforms if you want to talk about Python, Django, Django RF, Data Scraping (and more python stuff), Android (Java + Kotlin), Docker, Machine Learning, Julia, or any interesting technology you want. We can talk about coffee too, I am always ready to make new connections. Besides that I love travelling to different places and sometime I work on DIY projects.

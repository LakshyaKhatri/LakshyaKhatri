# Hi, My Name is Lakshya <img width="45" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LakshyaKhatri/LakshyaKhatri/master/img/waving_hand.gif">

## What I do:
I'm an SE at [Deqode](https://www.deqode.com) (NodeJS, RoR & React).

## My Interests:
- Building new software products.
- Optimizing slow code/architecture, simplifying complex systems and making everything future-proof. I can spend hours on code ([or even days](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/pull/2809)) if I have a somewhat clear goal.
- Learning about [new solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs) and mental models.
- Reading & journaling.

## Some things I believe:
- Grit produces results that compounds.
- Learning things is not a barrier for people. A human can learn anything and [produce incredible results](https://lakshya.codes/blog/my-journey-as-an-mlh-fellow/#projects-i-got-to-work-on-during-the-fellowship)
- Experience is irrelevant in this attention-driven economy.
- Enthusiasm and environments matter.
